            <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
                its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
                opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
                packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'
                will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
                accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
            from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
            looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,</p>

                <p>Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
                    Latin
                    words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
                    discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
                    Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
                    ethics,
                    very popular during the Renaissance.</p>

                <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some
                    form,
                    by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.</p>
